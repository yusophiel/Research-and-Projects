## 👋 About Me

I am an undergraduate student majoring in **Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence** at the University of Nottingham.  
My work lies at the intersection of **Reinforcement Learning, Quantitative Research, and Optimization Systems**.  
I enjoy building intelligent systems that connect algorithmic reasoning with real-world decision-making — from vehicle routing to financial markets.
