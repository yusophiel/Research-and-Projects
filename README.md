## About Me

I design intelligent computational systems that transform complexity into structure — systems that learn, adapt, and make hidden dynamics observable.
My work bridges **algorithmic reasoning**, **data-driven modeling**, and **optimization** — with a focus on applications in **financial markets** and **decision systems**.
Trained in **Computer Science and AI**, I apply **reinforcement learning**, **graph neural networks**, and **numerical optimization** to decision-making under uncertainty.
At the intersection of **AI**, **Data Science**, and **Financial Engineering**, I aim to develop computational methods that combine **quantitative precision with interpretability**, enabling dynamic systems to evolve toward **transparency and intelligence**.
